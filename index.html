      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to the Heligan Field Car Park – your convenient and scenic parking spot right next to the world-famous Lost Gardens of Heligan. For nearly 30 years, we've proudly provided visitors with a reliable and easy place to park, set against the backdrop of Cornwall’s stunning countryside.
<p>
  <p>
Our field is part of the Lobb family's working farm, where six generations have proudly cared for this land using traditional and sustainable farming methods. It's not just a car park – it’s part of a living, breathing landscape where we raise our own grass-fed beef and lamb, and grow fresh seasonal vegetables.
<p>
  <p>
You’ll also find our family-run Lobbs Farm Shop just a short stroll away. It's a celebration of Cornish and Westcountry produce, where we not only share the fruits of our own farm but also support and showcase over 60 other passionate local producers.
<p>
<p>
So whether you’re here to explore the gardens, enjoy the countryside, or discover the best of local food, we’re glad you’ve parked with us!

      <h2>Parking Information</h2>
      <p>
        Heligan Field Car Park is evolving to better serve visitors and the environment. To achieve this, we have introduced an ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) pay-on-exit system, alongside a tariff structure. This is designed to offer flexibility with options tailored to different visit lengths - whether you're here for a quick visit or a full day exploring the area.
As part of our commitment to sustainability, and alongside our existing solar panels, our future plan for the car park includes the installation of Electronic Vehicle (EV) charging stations to support visitors on reducing their environmental footprint. More to come on this soon!
      </p>
      <p>
       Our car park uses Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) to track when your vehicle enters and exits. Charges are calculated based on the duration of your stay. 
</p>
      <p>
        Simply pay before you leave — no need to display a ticket or rush back to your vehicle. Just drive in, enjoy your visit, and pay before exiting — it’s stress-free and convenient.
